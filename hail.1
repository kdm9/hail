.SH "NAME"
\fBhail\fR \- Extract lines from a file
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBhail\fR \fIFIRST\fR\-\fILAST\fR \.\.\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Hail gets its name from a contraction of \fBhead\fR and \fBtail\fR, the common alternative to this program\. It extracts lines from a file, taken on stdin, and prints them on stdout\. It\'s so simple that the *NIX wizards of old never bothered\. But I\'m lazy and prone to procrastination\.
.
.SH "SYNTAX"
Hail takes any number of \fBx\fR\-\fBy\fR pairings as arguments\. These pairs are integral numbers, corresponding to the first and last lines to print\. The final number may be excluded to indicate that the remainder of the file should be printed
.
