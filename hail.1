.SH "NAME"
\fBhail\fR \- Extract lines from a file
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBhail\fR \fIFIRST\fR\-\fILAST\fR \.\.\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Hail gets its name from a contraction of \fBhead\fR and \fBtail\fR, the common
alternative to this program\. It extracts lines from a file, taken on stdin,
and prints them on stdout\. It\'s so simple that the Unix wizards of old never
bothered\. But I\'m lazy and prone to procrastination\.
.
.SH "SYNTAX"
Hail takes any number of \fBx\fR\-\fBy\fR pairings as arguments\. These pairs
are (1-based) integral numbers, corresponding to the first and last lines to
print\. The final number may be excluded to indicate that the remainder of the
file should be printed
.
