hail
====

Extract lines from a file


Installation
------------

Hail has no dependencies other than a C compiler which implements the GNU-C99
standard. To install:

    git clone https://github.com/kdmurray91/hail.git
    cd hail
    make
    make install


About
-----

Hail gets its name from a contraction of `head` and `tail`, the common
alternative to this program. It extracts lines from a file, taken on stdin,
and prints them on stdout. It's so simple that the Unix wizards of old never
bothered. But I'm lazy and prone to procrastination.

Hail takes any number of `x`-`y` pairings as arguments. These pairs are
integral numbers, corresponding to the first and last lines to print. The
final number may be excluded to indicate that the remainder of the file
should be printed


Examples
--------

    # prints 1 through 10, i.e. does nothing
    seq 1 10 | hail 1-

    # prints 1 through 3, i.e. equivalent to `head -n 3`
    seq 1 10 | hail 1-3

    # prints 3 through 5, i.e. equivalent to `head -n 5 | tail -n 3` or `buthead 2 | head -n 3`
    seq 1 10 | hail 3-5

    # prints 5 through 10, i.e. equivalent to `tail -n +5` or `buthead 4`
    seq 1 10 | hail 5-

    # prints 2, 3, 5 and 7, which is where I'll give up on my comparisons to
    # head and tail
    seq 1 10 | hail 2-3 5-5 7-7
